# Project 3 - Wind Resource

This is my assignment 3 project.

It:
- loads ERA5 NetCDF files (1997–2008)
- computes wind speed and direction (10 m and 100 m)
- interpolates wind data to a location inside the Horns Rev box
- uses power law to get wind at hub height
- fits Weibull distribution and plots histogram
- plots wind rose
- computes AEP for NREL 5 MW and NREL 15 MW turbines
